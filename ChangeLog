    * Fixed a bug in rpvm_spawn where the last element of (char **) argv
      should be NULL.  There were two bug reports (thanks to Kurt Hornik
      <Kurt.Hornik@wu-wien.ac.at> and R. Woodrow Setzer, Jr.
      <Setzer.Woodrow@epamail.epa.gov>) about sporadic segfault in pvm_pkstr
      called by pvm_spawn.  Hopefully this will now be fixed.
