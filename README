INSTALLATION:
=============================================================================

1.  Install SPRNG 2.0 (http:/sprng.cs.fsu.edu).  Note that the
    generator pmlcg requires libgmp but it provides an outdated version of
    gmp.h.  Find the following line in sprng2.0/SRC/pmlcg/pmlcg.c:

    #include "gmp.h"

    and change it to

    #include <gmp.h>

    to use the system header file.  It won't compile otherwise. 

    If you encounter problems compiling SPRNG 2.0, this note
    http://www.biostat.umn.edu/~nali/rsprng.html might be of help.
    I have also made available some precompiled SPRNG packages at
    http://www.biostat.umn.edu/~nali/SoftwareListing.html.

2.  Install rsprng:

    R CMD INSTALL rsprng_version.tgz 
    
    If the SPRNG header file and library file are in a non-standard path use,
    
    R CMD INSTALL --configure-args=--with-sprng=/path/to/sprng rsprng_version.tgz 

    The header files of SPRNG are ssumed to be in /path/to/sprng/include and
    the library .a files are in /path/to/sprng/lib.  Alternative, one can also
    define environment variable SPRNG_ROOT to be the path (so that R CMD check
    can run).

    By default pointer checking for SPRNG is enabled, to disable it, pass
    '--configure-args=--disable-check-pointers' to 'R INSTALL'.

    libgmp.a is needed at linking.  If it is installed in a non-standard
    location, you can specify it via:

    R CMD INSTALL --configure-args='--with-gmp=/path/to/libgmp.a'.
